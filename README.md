# Eventwise

Built wuth NextJS (typeScript), Solidity and Tailwindcss for styling

## Inspiration
We all know what it feels like to cancel an event due to bad weather conditions.
Imagine the losses incurred by the actual event planners in situations like this.
I had a personal experience of these sorts that inspired this idea and i believe its a valid one that can be handled seamlessly on the blockchain.

## What it does
EventWise is an insurance platform designed to provide coverage to event-planners for their events.
This helps them minimize losses if the events are impacted negatively due to climate conditions.


## How we built it
- We built a NextJS client that interacts with our smart contracts, deployed on the sepolia ethereum testnet.
- Our smart contracts handle the insurance and claim settlements in a decentralized and trustless process.
- Its completely decentralized, so no centralized servers involved.

## Features
- Register insurance
- Paying  premium at intervals
- Registering events as they are booked.
- Register an insurance claim when your event incurs a loss.
- Verify the claim for settlement.
- Pay the event planner.

## Challenges we ran into
- Integrating chainlink AnyApi
- The AnyApi oracle on sepolia wasnt working, we had to use oracle from linkwell team(thanks guysü§ç)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Completing a working demo was really a proud moment for us.
- Building the client to be completely serverless and still working seamlessly.
- Integrating with AnyApi was a proud moment.

## What we learned
- Creating a functional DApp without any centralized servers.
- Interacting with chainlink oracles.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
